Problem 1
(a) README.md = Untracked
(b) README.md = Modified
    fun_problem.txt = Untracked
(c) README.md = Staged
    fun_problem.txt = Staged
(d) README.md = modified
    fun_problem.txt = modified
(e) README.md = Staged
    fun_problem.txt = Untracked
    The contents of fun_problem.txt are empty because we used git checkout which navigates to a 
    different branch. Because of this, the contents of fun_problem are moved.  
(f) README.md = modified
    After staging the README.md file to be pushed, we edited its contents again so it needs to be restaged, therefore its status is "modified".

Problem 6 (Note: For all instances I use big- "O" i mean theta)

1. bool empty() const:	O(1) [constant]
2. void push (const double& val) :	O(1)
3. double const& top() const: O(1) [constant]
4. void pop(): O(1) [constant]

For All functions, the big theta notation is a polynomial, which is the most efficient because it runs the same number of steps each time because we are only looking at the head or top of the stack.
